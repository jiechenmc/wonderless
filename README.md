# Wonderless
With the increase in the adoption of FaaS model, 
research on various aspects of FaaS and Serverless 
computing is also evolving. These aspects have a wide 
variety including communication, security, cold start, 
and cost optimization. Despite its popularity, we still 
know very little about how Serverless computing is used 
in practice. With *Wonderless*, we aim to bridge this gap.

Wonderless is a dataset consisting of 1,877 real-world 
Serverless applications. Both researchers in academia 
and industry can benefit from real-world use cases in 
this dataset to explore the Serverless world from 
the viewpoint of open-source communities. Wonderless 
can be replicated and extended. To do so, please
